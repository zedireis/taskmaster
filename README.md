- What is it?
  
  A Discord Bot to find a common timeslot between pairs.
  
- Why I made it?
 
  As a student working with multiple people on projects and with a internship on top, scheduling a meeting beacme very difficult because everyone had a different agenda.
  On top of that, others had their internship as well so we couldn't just have a common Google Calendar or something, because we had multiple calendars.
  So I needed to find a way to get a common timeslot that everyone could attend.
  
- How does it work?

  People add their calendars (more on that later). Then choose the people who will attend the meeting and the time it will take, for example: Pedro, Nuno and JosÃ© are in for a 30 min meeting.
  Then choose calculate and Taskmaster will get the calendars and find a timeslot in the current week.
